excerpt: The moral of the story is that advertising works.
---

Isaac got upset all the sudden and seemed real worried today while we were walking through Sam’s. He was insistent we had to go back a few aisles because we had forgotten something.  

I just assumed there was some monster truck toy or giant water slide he wanted to throw a fit about not getting. But, we caved and went back to look for the “missed” product. 

Turns out, Isaac was insistent that we needed this giant thing of Downy Unstoppables because “it keeps our laundry fresh for weeks!” He had seen it “on granny's tv.” 

Moral of the story: advertising works. 

And, also, we may not be keeping our laundry smelling fresh enough for Isaac.
