Obligatory end of the year post...

I started going through my phone to look for 5-6 photos that would symbolize my favorite memories from 2020. Before long, I had marked dozens and dozens of photos.
Each one of these pictures remind me of something I loved in the past year. And, honestly, I can think of at least a dozen more that I don’t have pictures of off the top of my head. 

2020 was a tough year, but it was a year full of love, laughter, and memories for my little family. 

Many people have faced real hardships this year. People have lost loved ones, had sickness, suffered from financial and mental health struggles because of the pandemic, and even much more. My heart goes out to any of you who have had a particularly dark year. 

As I look through these photos, though, it was yet another reminder for me to learn to appreciate the good things in life while they are happening. 
This year hasn’t been all sunshine and rainbows for any of us, but I think that’s okay. 

I can’t wait to see what memories we make in 2021, but I have a feeling there will be a lot of good ones.
