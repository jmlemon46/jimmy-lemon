Something you may or may not know about me is that I love humans. 

I really like most humans I meet. There are some humans that I’m really fond of.
If I don’t particularly like you, chances are you’ve been pretty awful to a human that means an awful lot to me. 

2020 has been difficult for most humans, but we’re entering a season this human has been dreading for several months. 

With the pandemic raging, more and more humans are either sick, isolated, quarantining, or grieving the loss of a loved one. 

Many humans are just flat tired. They are exhausted from wearing masks, having to be distanced from loved ones, juggling working from home with home responsibilities, and all kinds of other changes to their daily routines. 

They do this because they, too, love other humans, but it’s still hard. 
There are humans who spend their days in the medical field taking care of other humans when they get sick. I’m so appreciative of these humans, and so many of them are overwhelmed and struggling right now. 

Some humans have lost jobs, or their businesses are struggling under the weight of the pandemic. They are scrambling trying to figure out how to support the other humans that rely on them. 

In addition to all of this, the holidays are a tough time of year for many humans. It’s the time when we most miss the other humans who are no longer with us. We don’t get as much sunlight. There’s the already yearly seasonal affective disorder and the pressure of making the holidays perfect. We won’t even talk about the financial pressures of it all. 

All of this comes together to make for some really tough sledding these next couple of months. Because of some really smart humans, there’s help on the way. But, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t some humans that really need help right now. 
With depression, suicides, and all sorts of other really dark things on the rise, it’s now more important than ever to be there for each other even though it’s hard to be together right now. 

I don’t really know what I’m trying to say with this post besides this: we’re all humans trying to do our very best to get by. I’d like to see as many of us make it through all this as possible.  My heart aches for the amount of pain, sorrow and struggle being experienced by so many right now. 

Be kind. Show some love. Check in on people who are struggling. Drop a meal off on a friend’s doorstep just because. Call that relative that may be lonely right now. Do something kind for a stranger. Tell someone you love them. 

We can argue all we want over all kinds of things down the road. But, right now, let’s figure out how to be there for each other, so we can get through this thing together. Times may be tough, but they aren’t tougher than us. 

If you’re a human that’s struggling right now, please reach out. You don’t have to go through it alone.
