excerpt: Everyone knows that Halloween is really Christmas Eve.

'Twas the night before Christmas 🎄, or so it would seem,  
But the date on the calendar read Halloween 🎃.  
The children were dressed as goblins 🧟‍♂️ and ghouls 🧟‍♀️,  
While parents pilfered their candy 🍬, those sly old fools.  

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter 🎅,  
I sprang from my porch to see what was the matter.  
And what to my wondering eyes 👀 should appear,  
But a sleigh 🛷full of Christmas decor, oh dear! 😱

With a jolly old driver, so lively and quick,  
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick 🎅.  
"Enough with the pumpkins 🎃, the ghosts 👻, and the frights 👹,  
It's time to get ready for 🎄Christmas delights! 🍭”

He whistled and shouted and called to his team,  
"Let's go, my dear reindeer 🦌, it's time to leave Halloween 🎃!"  
And I heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight,  
"Merry Christmas EVE 🎄 to all, and to all a good night!"
