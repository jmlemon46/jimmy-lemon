excerpt: "Moving offices was exhausting. Little things I took for granted throw me off in the new space. But, I'm looking forward to a fresh work setting."

I moved offices this week.  
It was exhausting. 

I found it challenging to get work done with all my professional belongings scattered throughout our office hallway for the better part of the week.

Not only was I physically moving my computer and other items to another room, but I also took the opportunity to purge things that I didnâ€™t necessarily need.

Itâ€™s astonishing how much stuff you accumulate over 4 years. I ended up throwing away multiple bags and a couple of boxes of trash.

Itâ€™s wild how much your office becomes your home away from home (for good or bad). 

Even simple things, like my deskâ€”which is exactly the same as the one Iâ€™ve had for nearly half a decadeâ€”are throwing me off. It sits at the opposite orientation, and I canâ€™t figure out where to rest my arms while typing.

However, as I start to hang things on the wall and clear out the clutter, Iâ€™m looking forward to a fresh start.

After 4 years in the same office, a little change of scenery might be good for me!
