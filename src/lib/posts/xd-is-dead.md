XD has been my go to choice for web design for several years. Adobe has officially given up on it. You can’t even download it anymore. 

So, with much trepidation, I’m transitioning to using figma. 

Figma is and has been the big boy on the block in UX/UI for a few years now, but I’ve always been an XD guy since so much of what we do at Bullseye is inside the Adobe ecosystem. 

I have one site down, and let me tell you….
I feel like I’m designing with two left hands. 

I have found myself spending more time fighting my own muscle memory than I have actually designing. It’s “pretty much” the same, but also really really different. 

I know it’s just a matter of time before working in figma will be second nature. I’m excited to see all the resources and the vast community behind figma. I think some of the features will translate better to building on the web.

But, in the meantime, it feels a lot like trying to eat soup with chopsticks.
