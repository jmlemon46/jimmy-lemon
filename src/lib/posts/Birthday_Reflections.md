For my birthday, my amazing wife and sister-in-law surprised me with a treasure chest full of dozens of letters from people in my life. 

I knew I shouldnâ€™t have, but I stayed up way too late and read each one. ðŸ˜´

Iâ€™m honestly still processing the emotions of it all. But, to those who wrote, I can tell you Iâ€™m incredibly grateful for every person who took time to write me a note for my birthday. I love you all and hope to reach out to thank each one of you personally. 

2020 has been a really tough year. Iâ€™ve personally been incredibly fortunate so far to have avoided the virus and much of the collateral hardships from the pandemic.

But, I want to be honest. As a people person, my 35th year around the sun has affected me in more ways than I can share here. I often feel almost guilty for the dark days because of how truly blessed I am. 

But, Iâ€™m grateful.

Iâ€™m grateful for the wonderful people in my life - those who I can be around right now and those I look forward to be able to spend time with hopefully soon.

Iâ€™m grateful for the people in my corner even when my emotions try to convince me Iâ€™m standing alone.

Iâ€™m grateful for the connections Iâ€™ve made even when I feel isolated.

And, Iâ€™m grateful for those who show their love for me even when itâ€™s hard for me to see it. 

Most of all, Iâ€™ve continued to learn this year just how precious life is and how important it is to cherish the the people in it. 

If I could ask for one more thing in honor of my birth this year, I would encourage you to reach out to those you love or even someone youâ€™ve drifted apart from.

Tell people what you appreciate about them. Check in on them to see how they are doing. Share memories, crack some jokes, tell them you love them. Donâ€™t wait until someoneâ€™s funeral to say the things left unsaid. Say it publicly, say it privately...however you say it, just say it. 

Thank you Megan, Amy, and everyone who wrote a note, sent a message, or wrote on my Facebook wall. I appreciate everyone of you more than you know. 

Oh, and itâ€™s still not too late to tell me how awesome I am if youâ€™re into that sort of thing.
