excerpt: "A simple change in perspective during a morning run led to a profound realization about life and how we choose to view our circumstances."

Sometimes a little change in perspective is all you need. 

The pre-sunrise sky caught my attention today during my morning run. So, I decided to snap a picture. 

The results were a little underwhelming. It just didn’t do the vivid colors I was seeing justice.

So, right in the middle of what’s usually a really busy road, I knelt to the ground in the middle of the street to snap picture number two. 

This time, the photo was much brighter and more interesting.

All it took to go from something that was dark and lifeless to something much more hopeful was a simple change in my perspective. 

When I was a kid, I thought being adult meant you finally got to be in control over most things in your life.

I’m learning that being an adult actually means you just become much more aware of how little of life you can control. 

So often, we can’t change our situations or our circumstances. We certainly can’t change our past. 

But, do you know what we can always control?

Our perspective. 

We can always control our attitudes and how we choose to view our circumstances. 

And, just like how a shift in perspective could bring life into an otherwise drab photo, changing our perspective on what life throws our way can help bring peace and hope into how we view our little slice of the world. 

What are some changes in perspective you’ve made? How has those changes impacted your life?

“I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. I can do all this through him who gives me strength.”
‭‭Philippians‬ ‭4:11-13‬ ‭
